# Azure Architecture Diagram Builder — MCP Server Tools

This is the running reference for every tool the MCP server exposes
([`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts)). Endpoint: `POST /mcp` (streamable-HTTP) with
`Authorization: Bearer <token from .env.mcp>`. Health: `GET /healthz`.

All tool design logic is deterministic (no LLM), read-only, and closed-world.
Artifact metadata such as creation timestamps can differ between otherwise
equivalent calls.
Each exposes a human-readable MCP title plus
`readOnlyHint: true`, `idempotentHint: true`, and `openWorldHint: false`.
They are design-time only — nothing deploys Azure resources.

## 1. `list_services`

**Module:** [`src/serviceCatalog.ts`](src/serviceCatalog.ts), generated data in
[`src/serviceCatalog.generated.json`](src/serviceCatalog.generated.json)

Browse the 94-service canonical AADB catalog. The MCP sidecar is generated from
the web app's `SERVICE_ICON_MAP`; it is not maintained as a second handwritten
catalog. Optionally filter by `category`. Use it first to resolve human
names/aliases to canonical service types before calling the other tools.

**Input:** `{ category?: string }` (valid categories are echoed in the response)

**Output:** `{ totalServices, categories[], services[] }` — each service carries
`{ key, displayName, category, aliases, hasPricingData, isUsageBased, costRange }`.
Also available as the `azure://catalog/services` resource.

All 13 tools advertise an MCP `outputSchema` and return `structuredContent` on
successful calls. Existing text payloads remain available for compatibility;
artifact tools include the generated SVG, HTML, Bicep, Terraform, or Markdown in
their structured result as well.

---

## 2. `validate_architecture`

**Module:** [`src/wafDetector.ts`](src/wafDetector.ts)

Deterministic Well-Architected Framework analysis (no LLM). Runs two rule
classes — **pattern** rules (architecture-wide anti-patterns) and **service**
rules (per-service best practices) — and returns a 0–100 score.

**Input:** `{ services[], connections?[] }`

**Output (`structuredContent`):**
```jsonc
{
  "score": 55,
  "totalFindings": 7,
  "patternsDetected": ["single-region"],
  "rulesApplied": { "pattern": N, "service": M },
  "regionalTopology": {
    "explicitServingRegions": ["eastus2"],
    "redundantServingTypes": [],
    "hasMultiRegionServingTier": false,
    "redundantDatabaseTypes": [],
    "hasMultiRegionDatabaseTier": false
  },
  "findingsByPillar": { "Security": { "count": 3, "findings": [ { "severity", "category", "issue", "recommendation", "resources" } ] } }
}
```

Regional and WAF findings require explicit topology evidence. Global routing
does not count as a second serving region, and a WAF policy must be associated
by an edge with Front Door or Application Gateway.

> The score is capped at the diagram layer. Topology findings are cleared by
> `harden_architecture` (§6); config-level findings are resolved by
> `generate_bicep` (§5) / `generate_terraform` (§11).

---

## 3. `estimate_costs`

**Modules:** [`src/costEstimator.ts`](src/costEstimator.ts), [`src/pricing.ts`](src/pricing.ts)

Numeric monthly costs from a distilled snapshot of the **Azure Retail Prices**
API, region- and term-aware.

**Input:** `{ services[] (name, type, region?, tier?, quantity?), region?, term? }`
- `services[].region`: per-service Azure region; overrides the request-level region
- `tier`: `basic | standard | premium` → low/expected/high SKU band
- `region`: `eastus2` (default), `centralus`, `westus2`, `australiaeast`,
  `canadacentral`, `brazilsouth`, `mexicocentral`, `westeurope`,
  `northeurope`, `uksouth`, `swedencentral`, `southeastasia`, `japaneast`,
  `centralindia`
- `term`: `payg` (default) or `reserved1yr`

`reserved1yr` means exact, SKU-specific one-year Savings Plan pricing. Each
low/expected/high tier uses its own meter when one exists; a tier without one
stays PAYG. The tool never extrapolates one SKU's discount to another.

**Output (`structuredContent`):** includes the backward-compatible
`totalMonthlyCost`, plus explicit fixed-baseline coverage and regional
provenance:

- `serviceCount` (input rows) and quantity-aware `totalResourceCount`
- `numericallyPricedResourceCount / totalResourceCount` and `numericCoveragePercent`
- `selectedMonthlyCost`, the quantity-aware aggregate of each service's selected
  tier; `totalMonthlyCost` remains the low/expected/high architecture band
- `isPartialBaseline`, `baselineLabel`, and categorized `excludedServices`
- per-estimate `requestedRegion`, `effectiveRegion`, and `regionProxyUsed`
- response-level `requestedRegions`, `effectiveRegions`, and proxy count

Services without distilled pricing fall back to a curated `catalogCostRange`
and are excluded from the numeric baseline. If a numeric estimate requests a
region outside the bundled snapshot, the fallback is explicit; the tool never
labels proxy rates as native rates for that region. Catalog/usage exclusions use
no regional meter and therefore retain the requested region without a proxy.

`pricingSource.generatedAt` is when the compact MCP sidecar was generated.
`pricesAsOf` is the newest contributing Azure Retail Prices meter effective
date among the returned estimates. The dates measure different things and may
differ.

---

## 3b. `compare_region_costs`

**Module:** [`src/regionalCostComparison.ts`](src/regionalCostComparison.ts)

Place the same services, quantities, tiers, and pricing term wholly in each
candidate region and compare the resulting numeric fixed-price baselines. This
tool composes `estimate_costs`; it does not maintain separate pricing rules.

**Input:**

```jsonc
{
  "services": [
    { "name": "Web", "type": "App Service", "quantity": 2 },
    { "name": "Gateway", "type": "API Management", "tier": "standard" },
    { "name": "Monitor", "type": "Azure Monitor" }
  ],
  "regions": ["eastus2", "centralus", "westeurope"],
  "baselineRegion": "eastus2",
  "term": "payg"
}
```

- `regions` requires 2–14 distinct values after normalization.
- `baselineRegion` must be one of the candidates; it defaults to the first.
- Services intentionally have no `region` override: each candidate represents
  the same architecture placed wholly in that region.
- `term` is `payg` or exact-SKU `reserved1yr`, matching `estimate_costs`.

**Output (`structuredContent`):**

- `comparisons[]`: native region, meter date, low/expected/high band,
  selected-tier baseline, coverage, exclusions, category totals, and delta from
  the baseline region.
- `ranking[]`, `cheapest`, `mostExpensive`, and `potentialMonthlySavings` when
  every requested candidate is natively priced and comparable. Ranking uses the
  aggregate selected-tier monthly baseline, not the middle band unconditionally.
- `unsupportedRegions` and a human-readable `rankingReason` when ranking is
  withheld.
- `pricingSource`: bundled snapshot generation time, currency, and all native
  regions.

Ranking is deliberately withheld if any requested region lacks a native
snapshot, fewer than two native candidates remain, the baseline is unsupported,
numeric service coverage differs, currencies differ, a proxy appears, or every
service is usage-based/catalog-range. Partial fixed-price baselines can be ranked
only when the same numeric service set is covered everywhere; exclusions remain
visible per region. The tool never uses heuristic regional multipliers and never
substitutes proxy pricing.

---

## 4. `generate_manifest`

Emit an **`az prototype` interchange manifest** (schemaVersion 1.0) from the
architecture — importable into the web app or consumable by `az prototype build`.

**Input:** `{ projectName, location?, iacTool?, services[], connections?[], groups?[] }`

**Output:** the manifest JSON (`{ schemaVersion, architecture: { ... } }`).
Optional normalized `services[].region` values round-trip back via
`import_architecture` (§10).

---

## 5. `generate_bicep`

**Module:** [`src/bicepGenerator.ts`](src/bicepGenerator.ts)

Deployable **Bicep** with Well-Architected secure defaults pre-set, so the
config-level WAF findings a diagram can't express are resolved out of the gate.

### Coverage (secure defaults pre-set)

| Service | Hardening |
|---------|-----------|
| App Service | HTTPS-only, TLS 1.2, managed identity, health check, autoscale, staging slot |
| Key Vault | soft-delete 90d, purge protection, RBAC |
| Storage | HTTPS-only, TLS 1.2, no public blob access |
| Cosmos DB | automatic failover, continuous backup |
| SQL Database | server + DB, **TDE**, **auditing** (Azure Monitor), TLS 1.2, no public network, Entra-only admin |
| Redis | TLS 1.2 minimum |
| Front Door / WAF Policy | Premium profile + WAF policy (Prevention mode, Microsoft managed rule set) |
| AI Search / Container Apps | keyless / HTTPS-only ingress, managed identity |
| Monitoring | Log Analytics + Application Insights |

Managed identities are granted **Key Vault Secrets User**. Services without a
template emit a commented placeholder (reported in `servicesGeneric`).

**Input:** `{ projectName?, location?, iacTool?, services[], connections?[] }`
**Output:** `{ iacTool, servicesCovered[], servicesGeneric[], findingsResolved[], findingsResolvedCount, note, bicep }`

> Terraform counterpart: `generate_terraform` (§11).

---

## 6. `harden_architecture` (new)

**Module:** [`src/hardener.ts`](src/hardener.ts)

Collapses the manual *add-service → re-validate* loop (that agents like Scout
previously did by hand) into a single deterministic call. Given an
architecture, it detects the pattern-level WAF anti-patterns and adds the
remediating services + connections, iterating until the pattern set stops
shrinking, then re-validates.

### Patterns cleared (topology / diagram-addressable)

| Anti-pattern | Remediation added |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `no-identity` | Microsoft Entra ID (+ authN/authZ edge) |
| `no-waf` | Azure Front Door + WAF Policy on the edge |
| `single-region` | With `secondaryRegion`: duplicate an explicit serving type in that region and route Front Door to both instances. Without it: unresolved. |
| `no-api-gateway` | API Management (unified gateway) |
| `direct-db-access` | Reroutes frontend→DB through the API layer |
| `single-database` | With `secondaryRegion`: add same-type `<db> Replica` in that explicit region. Without it: unresolved. |
| `no-cache` | Azure Cache for Redis |
| `no-key-vault` | Key Vault |
| `no-backup` | Azure Backup |
| `no-monitoring` | Application Insights + Azure Monitor |

> **Scope:** only *topology* is fixed here. Config-level findings (HTTPS-only,
> TDE, Key Vault soft-delete, autoscale, …) are **not** diagram-addressable and
> are resolved by `generate_bicep`. So the WAF score rises but is still capped
> at the diagram layer — that's expected and intentional.

### Input

```jsonc
{
  "secondaryRegion?": "centralus",
  "services":   [{ "name": "...", "type": "...", "description?": "...", "groupId?": "..." }],
  "connections?": [{ "from": "...", "to": "...", "label?": "...", "type?": "sync|async|optional" }],
  "groups?":    [{ "id": "...", "label": "..." }]
}
```

Regional evidence is conservative:

- Front Door, Traffic Manager, WAF, CDN, and Entra ID do not count as a second region.
- WAF protection requires an explicit association edge between a WAF policy and
  Front Door or Application Gateway; detached policy nodes do not qualify.
- Unlocated services do not prove or disprove regional redundancy.
- `single-region` clears only when the same serving type is explicitly present
  in at least two regions.
- `single-database` clears only when every database type is explicitly present
  in at least two regions.
- The hardener never invents a target region. Pass `secondaryRegion` when
  deterministic regional remediation is intended.

### Output

```jsonc
{
  "summary":   "Hardened: WAF score 10 → 18. Patterns 7 → 0 (all cleared). 7 change(s) applied.",
  "before":    { "score": 10, "patternsDetected": [...], "totalFindings": N },
  "after":     { "score": 18, "patternsDetected": [], "totalFindings": M },
  "changes":   [{ "pattern": "no-identity", "action": "...", "addedServices": [...], "addedConnections": ["A → B"] }],
  "unresolved":[],          // topology patterns that couldn't be auto-fixed
  "note":      "Regional findings remain unresolved without secondaryRegion; otherwise all remediated pattern findings are revalidated.",
  "services":  [...],       // hardened architecture — pass straight to render_diagram / generate_bicep / export_reactflow_scene
  "connections":[...],
  "groups":    [...]        // new groups (Global Edge & Security, API Gateway, Security & Ops) appended
}
```

### Typical flow

`validate_architecture` → `harden_architecture` → `render_diagram` (show the
hardened topology) → `generate_bicep` (resolve config-level findings) →
`export_reactflow_scene` (hand to the web app).

Idempotent: hardening an already-hardened architecture is a no-op. This is
exercised through the public Streamable HTTP contract by `npm run test:contracts`.

---

## 7. `get_waf_rules`

**Module:** [`src/wafDetector.ts`](src/wafDetector.ts)

Query the WAF rule knowledge base that powers `validate_architecture`. Filter by
`pillar` and/or `serviceType`.

**Input:** `{ pillar?, serviceType? }` — pillar ∈ Reliability, Security, Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency

**Output (`structuredContent`):** `{ totalRules, filters, rulesByPillar{}, rules[] }`
where each rule has `{ id, pillar, severity, category, issue, recommendation, appliesTo[], pattern? }`. Also exposed as the `azure://waf/rules` resource.

---

## 8. `render_diagram`

**Modules:** [`src/layoutEngine.ts`](src/layoutEngine.ts), [`src/svgRenderer.ts`](src/svgRenderer.ts), [`src/htmlRenderer.ts`](src/htmlRenderer.ts)

Render the architecture as **SVG** (for markdown/SpecKit embedding) or a
self-contained interactive **HTML** viewer (pan, zoom, hover tooltips). Uses
official Azure icons, category colors, dagre-based tiered layout, orthogonal
edges with 2-line collision-avoided labels, distinct per-group header colors,
and a footer band (wrapped legend + cost total). Best-effort per-node cost
badges come from the same pricing resolution as `estimate_costs`.

**Input:** `{ services[], connections?[], groups?[], title?, format? (svg|html), direction? (TB|LR), theme? (light|dark), profile? (presentation|technical|cost), region?, author?, generatedBy? }`

`services[].region` overrides the render-level `region` for cost enrichment.

**Output:** the SVG or HTML markup in both the existing text content and
`structuredContent.content`. New clients should read the structured result;
the duplicate text payload remains for backward compatibility.

MCP Apps-capable hosts such as Claude Desktop discover
`ui://azure-diagram-builder/diagram.html` through the tool's
`_meta.ui.resourceUri` and mount the result as an interactive inline view. The
resource uses `text/html;profile=mcp-app`; hosts without MCP Apps support keep
receiving the existing text and structured payloads.
See [`CLAUDE-DESKTOP.md`](CLAUDE-DESKTOP.md) for the verified local setup,
smoke test, and troubleshooting guide.

- `presentation` (default): semantic reflow for ultra-wide capability groups and global/primary/secondary regional architectures, graph-derived request paths, WAF policy associations, quieter supporting edges, representative labels, larger text, and no pricing.
- `technical`: natural layout with every connection label and no pricing.
- `cost`: presentation composition and edge hierarchy plus per-node cost badges/ranges and a fixed-priced-baseline footer. Variable and ranged items are explicitly excluded from that baseline. `region` applies only to this profile; set it to `none` to suppress pricing enrichment.

---

## 9. `export_reactflow_scene`

Export a **React Flow scene JSON** compatible with the web app (Open / Import
Architecture). Reuses the dagre layout for positions and the web app icon
catalog for icon paths.

**Input:** `{ services[], connections?[], groups?[], architectureName?, architecturePrompt?, author?, direction? (TB|LR|auto), region?, workflow?[] }`.
Services and connections may carry optional stable `id` values.
- `direction: auto` (default) picks **LR** for 4+ groups or dense graphs, else **TB**.

**Output:** the React Flow scene JSON. Round-trips back via `import_architecture` (§10).
Per-service regions are preserved in node data and embedded pricing provenance.
React Flow node IDs remain deterministic name-derived routing IDs; canonical
service IDs are stored in `node.data.architectureId`. Original group IDs are in
`group.data.architectureGroupId`. Explicit connection IDs are used as edge IDs
and also stored in `edge.data.architectureId`.

---

## 10. `import_architecture`

**Module:** [`src/importer.ts`](src/importer.ts), ARM adapter in
[`src/armImporter.ts`](src/armImporter.ts)

The inverse of `generate_manifest` and `export_reactflow_scene` — closes the
round-trip so an agent can reload a previously saved design and keep working —
and a deterministic reader for **ARM deployment templates**.

### Accepts

| Format | Detection | Type recovery |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| az prototype **manifest** | has `architecture` | explicit `services[].type` (lossless) |
| React Flow **scene** | has `nodes` | `data.azureServiceType` → icon-path reverse-lookup → `data.label` |
| **ARM template** | `$schema` contains `deploymentTemplate.json`, or `resources` + `contentVersion` | ARM resource type (+ `kind`) → canonical catalog type |

### Input

```jsonc
{
  "content": "<JSON string — a manifest, a React Flow scene, or an ARM template>",
  "format?": "auto | manifest | reactflow | arm"   // auto-detected when omitted
}
```

### Output

```jsonc
{
  "summary": "Imported reactflow: 3 service(s), 1 connection(s), 1 group(s).",
  "format": "manifest | reactflow | arm",
  "projectName?": "...",
  "location?": "...",
  "iacTool?": "bicep | terraform",
  "author?": "...",
  "architecturePrompt?": "...",
  "warnings": [ ... ],          // non-fatal parse notes (e.g. unresolved type)
  "services": [ ... ],          // canonical shape — feed straight into any tool
  "connections": [ ... ],
  "groups": [ ... ],
  "workflow": [ ... ],
  "coverage?": {                // ARM imports only
    "totalResources": 699, "mapped": 5, "folded": 694,
    "skipped": 0, "skippedTypes": [],
    "edgeCount": 1,
    "canonicalServiceCount": 4,
    "uncanonicalizedTypes": ["Container Apps Environment"]
  }
}
```

For manifests, `services[].region` is preserved. For React Flow scenes, region
is recovered from `data.region` or `data.pricing.region`.

### ARM templates

Parsing is delegated to the web app's canonical deterministic extractor
(`src/services/armExtractor.ts`), copied into the server at build time by
`npm run sync:arm`, so the web app and this tool read templates identically.
A real `az group export` is mostly noise, so the adapter reports what happened
instead of hiding it:

- `name` is the **real Azure resource name**, resolved through
  `[parameters('x')]` default values and de-duplicated (`shared`, `shared (2)`).
- `type` is a canonical catalog type when one genuinely matches. A resource
  label with no honest equivalent (for example `Container Apps Environment`,
  `App Service Plan`, `SQL Server`) keeps its ARM label, is listed in
  `coverage.uncanonicalizedTypes`, and is flagged in `warnings` — it is never
  remapped to a different service, so pricing and WAF rules simply do not apply.
- `region` comes from a literal `location` or a resolvable `[parameters('x')]`
  default. Runtime expressions such as `resourceGroup().location` yield no
  region rather than a guess.
- `description` carries the raw ARM resource type for provenance.
- Connections come from real `dependsOn` and `resourceId(...)` references, never
  inferred; `groups` are the extractor's category zones.
- Child/config sub-resources are **folded** into their parent (`coverage.folded`)
  and unmapped resource types are **skipped** and listed in
  `coverage.skippedTypes`.

### Typical flow

`import_architecture` → `validate_architecture` / `harden_architecture` /
`render_diagram`. Edges that touch group nodes are dropped; service types are
reverse-resolved from the icon map (`ICON_FILE_TO_TYPE` in `index.ts`) when a
scene has no explicit type field.

---

## 11. `generate_terraform` (new)

**Module:** [`src/terraformGenerator.ts`](src/terraformGenerator.ts)

Terraform (azurerm provider `~> 4.0`) counterpart to `generate_bicep`. Emits a
provider block + resource group, then the same secure-default resources so the
config-level WAF findings resolve out of the gate.

### Coverage (secure defaults pre-set)

| Service | azurerm resource(s) | Hardening |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| App Service | `azurerm_service_plan` + `azurerm_linux_web_app` (+ slot, autoscale) | `https_only`, TLS 1.2, `identity`, health check, autoscale, staging slot |
| Key Vault | `azurerm_key_vault` | soft-delete 90d, purge protection, RBAC, no public network |
| Storage | `azurerm_storage_account` | HTTPS-only, TLS 1.2, no public/nested access, ZRS |
| Cosmos DB | `azurerm_cosmosdb_account` | automatic failover, continuous backup, Session consistency |
| SQL Database | `azurerm_mssql_server` + `azurerm_mssql_database` + `azurerm_mssql_server_extended_auditing_policy` | TDE, auditing, TLS 1.2, no public network, Entra-only admin |
| Redis | `azurerm_redis_cache` | TLS 1.2 min, non-SSL port disabled |
| Front Door / WAF | `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_profile` + `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_firewall_policy` | Premium profile + WAF (Prevention mode, Microsoft managed rules) |
| AI Search | `azurerm_search_service` | keyless (`local_authentication_enabled = false`), identity |
| Container Apps | `azurerm_container_app*` | HTTPS-only ingress, managed identity, LA-backed env |
| Monitoring | `azurerm_log_analytics_workspace` + `azurerm_application_insights` | workspace-based |

Managed identities are granted **Key Vault Secrets User** via
`azurerm_role_assignment` (keyless auth). Services without a template emit a
commented placeholder and are listed in `servicesGeneric`.

### Output

```jsonc
{
  "iacTool": "terraform",
  "servicesCovered": [ ... ],
  "servicesGeneric": [ ... ],
  "findingsResolved": [ { "ruleId", "pillar", "service", "setting", "terraformAttribute" } ],
  "findingsResolvedCount": 12,
  "note": "...",
  "terraform": "terraform { ... }"   // full HCL
}
```

> Use `generate_bicep` for Bicep and `generate_terraform` for Terraform — they
> share coverage and secure-default semantics so agents can offer either format.

---

## 12. `generate_deployment_guide` (new)

**Module:** [`src/deploymentGuide.ts`](src/deploymentGuide.ts)

Produces a Markdown deployment **runbook** for the architecture, tailored to the
chosen IaC tool. Pairs with `generate_bicep` / `generate_terraform` (which emit
the IaC the guide deploys).

### Sections (7 steps)

1. Prerequisites (Azure CLI, role, Bicep/Terraform, quota)
2. `az login` + subscription select
3. Region & naming
4. Resource group create
5. **Deploy** — `az deployment group create` (Bicep) or `terraform init/plan/apply`
6. **Post-deploy hardening checklist** — derived from the WAF *service-level*
   findings (`detectWafPatterns`), so operators verify the settings the IaC
   pre-sets (HTTPS-only, TLS, TDE, soft-delete, …)
7. **Smoke tests** — per-service verification hints (deduped by resolved type)
8. Teardown (`az group delete` or `terraform destroy`)

### Input / output

Input mirrors the IaC tools: `{ services, connections?, projectName?, location?, iacTool? }`
(`iacTool`: `bicep` default, or `terraform`).

```jsonc
{
  "iacTool": "bicep | terraform",
  "steps": 7,
  "checklistItems": 8,       // config findings turned into checklist items
  "markdown": "# Deployment Guide — ..."
}
```

> Design-time only — the guide documents the steps, it never deploys.

---

## Resources

Beyond tools, the server exposes read-only MCP **resources** so clients can
browse reference data without a tool round-trip (they're cacheable):

| URI | Title | Contents |
|-----|-------|----------|
| `azure://catalog/services` | Azure service catalog | Every known service: category, aliases, pricing availability, cost range |
| `azure://waf/rules` | WAF rules | Pattern rules + per-service best practices used by `validate_architecture` |
| `azure://pricing/meta` | Pricing metadata | Regions and priced service entries available to `estimate_costs` |

All return `application/json`.

## Contract verification

Run `npm run test:contracts` from `mcp-server/`. The test builds the standalone
server, starts its Streamable HTTP transport with a temporary bearer token, and
verifies unauthenticated rejection, the exact 12-tool / 3-resource / 3-prompt
inventory, every tool title and safety annotation, a smoke call to every tool
handler, direct requests with missing and stale session IDs, structured PAYG
pricing, forced-format import, hardening idempotency, and both Bicep and
Terraform deployment-guide paths.

## Prompts

Reusable MCP **prompt templates** that guide any client through the full
design workflow:

| Name | Argument | What it drives |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `design-secure-web-app` | `workload` | Propose → validate → harden → cost → render → bicep for a secure web app |
| `design-event-driven-platform` | `workload` | Same flow for an ingest→process→store→analytics platform |
| `harden-and-cost` | `region?` | Import (if needed) → validate → harden → cost → render → bicep on an existing design |
